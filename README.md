# HYPERdashboard

This project aims to demonstrate how to connect the [Hyperledger Explorer](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/explorer) to a [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) blockchain.

In current status, it can be integrated to Fabric Sample Balance Transfer, in a static mode. Possibly it might be integrated into another Hyperledger projects dynamically, or via parameters. This must be evaluated and has potential to be integrated into the original Hyperledger Explorer Linux project.

In evaluation phase by now.
